    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Choila is a very popular dish in Nepal. It is mainly served as an appetizer course and is admired if served with local booze. Choila is served in almost every restaurant and is prepared in many households. I never was fond of choila until I discovered this way of making it. Back in Nepal, choila usually is made from boiled meat (at least what I have seen). And that is why it used to be my least favorite dish, however nowadays, it is one of my favorites :) I am very picky when it comes to meat. Those who are like me will enjoy this recipe and of course those who love meat whatsoever will love it as well :) </p>
