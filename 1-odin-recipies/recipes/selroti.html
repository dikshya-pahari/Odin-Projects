    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Sel Roti is a traditional homemade, sweet, ring-shaped rice bread/doughnut. My mum makes for all visits and festivals throughout Dashain and Tihar, widely celebrated Hindu festivals in Nepal.
        Today I'm sharing this very special recipe from her, it is time consuming but worth to go through all, everyone loves it. The ingredients are so simple, but my Mum makes it so special which I learnt to share this recipe with you.</p>

        <h4>Recipe</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First prepare all the ingredients required above.</li>
            <li>Remove the access dirt from the rice, put it into a pot and add water until above from the surface of the rice. Cover and let it soak more than 3 hours or at least.</li>
            <li>After 3 hours drain the water from rice very well and pastel it until 80% percent done, it means let still to be grainy a bit, do not make it fine flour. After transfer it to a large plate or Naglo then mix and mash by your hands with strength around 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now heat the Ghee, add into the Rice flour and again mix and mash, until it absorbs the Ghee around 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Dry roast Fenugreek Seeds until it brown and make it fine powder, you can use blender, Silauto or Morter and Pastel.</li>
            <li>Heat a cup of water and set aside.</li>
            <li>Now get back to the flour, add Sugar that you prefer, Fenugreek Powder and Baking Soda/Powder. Mix it very well with strength around 5 minutes. After transfer to a deep pot and add in the warm water little by little and make a thick liquid dough, cover it and let it rest at least or more than 2 hours.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile prepare little sticks, after the 2 hours warm up little bit of water, set aside.</li>
            <li>Now put a Pan on the heat, the heat needs to be high. In Nepal to make this kind of Roti we use deep and heavy metal pan, if you have something like this is good. Add in half liter oil or enough oil to cover the bread. Let it get hot meanwhile prepare the dough, add it little warm water, mix it very well until it become little thick, smooth and at the same time drops smoothly. Remember the dough needs to be little thick, smooth and runny, it means you need to be able to hold in your hand and still drop smoothly when you want.</li>
            <li>Check if the oil is hot with a little bit of dough on the stick, if the dough becomes brown with in a few seconds then the oil is hot enough.</li>
            <li>Now pull a palm full of rice liquid dough and drop it fast in a ring shape in the hot oil and let it fry around 30 to 40 seconds or until it becomes light brown, meanwhile you can make it nice with the stick. Turn it upside down with a stick and fry it 20 seconds. After with the help of sticks pull up, let it drop the oil and place the Sel Roti on the plate. Make all of them like this. Enjoy!</li>
